# Task Manager

A simple web application to manage daily tasks, built with HTML, CSS (Neon Style), and JavaScript. It uses localStorage to persist tasks across browser sessions.

## Features
- Add new tasks easily.
- Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox.
- Delete tasks when finished.
- Automatically saves tasks in the browser using localStorage.
- Modern neon-inspired design.

## Project Structure
```
Task-Manager/
│── index.html      # Application interface
│── style.css       # Neon styling
│── script.js       # App logic (CRUD + localStorage)
```

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Type a task in the input field and click Add Task.
3. You can:
   - Mark tasks as completed
   - Delete tasks
4. All tasks are saved automatically in your browser.

## UI Design
- Dark theme with Neon Blue and Pink effects.
